                            <img src="iron-man-movie-2008.jpg" alt="Iron Man poster">
                            <p>This is the beginning of the MCU, Marvel Cinematic Universe. Robert Downey Jr. plays a lead role
                                as Tony Stark. Tony Stark the son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. 
                                When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, 
                                he's given a ride on enemy lines. 
                                That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. 
                                He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. 
                                In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. 
                                While escaping the cave he was helped by Dr. Ho Yinsen and dies. He told Tony not to waste his life. 
                                Thus Iron Man is born.
